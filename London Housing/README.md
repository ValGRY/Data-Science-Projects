Main goal of this project was to find out which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades.
There are 32 boroughs within Greater London.    
Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data will reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.

Conclusions:    
After cleaning and analyzing data from the London Datastore and looking at the graphs, I came to the conclusion that the Housing prices have been growing from 1998 to 2018, except prices dropped around 2009.   
Based on average prices by each borough from 1998 to 2018, the North East borough is the most expensive.
