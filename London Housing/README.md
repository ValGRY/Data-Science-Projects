Goal:    
Main goal of this project was to find out which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades.

Conclusions:    
After cleaning and analyzing data from the London Datastore and looking at the graphs, I came to the conclusion that the Housing prices have been growing from 1998 to 2018, except prices dropped around 2009.   
Based on average prices by each borough from 1998 to 2018, the North East borough is the most expensive.

Main challenge of the project:
 
The main challenge of this project was to find out all the correct steps and solutions that I needed to complete it.

With the help of Springboard, Google and the notes that I made I was able to finish the project and got the result I needed.
Even though I finished this project, it is still hard to keep in mind all the steps and codes, and solutions. But, more practice will help a lot.
