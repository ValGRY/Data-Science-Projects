# The Red Wine

The main goal is to see how regression analysis looks in Python and jupyter!

***I will use exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression to predict alcohol levels in wine with a model that's as accurate as possible***.

I am going try a *univariate* analysis (one involving a single explanatory variable) as well as a *multivariate* one (involving multiple explanatory variables), and I will iterate together towards a decent model by the end of the project


Iam going to use the red wine dataset, wineQualityReds.csv. This dataset is available on Kaggle, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/piyushgoyal443/red-wine-dataset).


**1. Sourcing and loading** 
- Import relevant libraries
- Load the data 
- Exploring the data
- Choosing a dependent variable
 
**2. Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing**
- Visualizing correlations
  
  
**3. Modeling** 
- Train/Test split
- Making a Linear regression model: first model
- Making a Linear regression model: second model: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) 
- Making a Linear regression model: third model: multiple linear regression
- Making a Linear regression model: fourth model: avoiding redundancy

**4. Evaluating and concluding** 
- Reflection 
- Which model was best?
